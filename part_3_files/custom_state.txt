1. The Info_request state indicates that the user is seeking additional info or clarification, so it 
triggers the chatbot to provide detailed explanations when users want to know more
2. The custom chat node is InfoRequestChat, which inherits from CHat. It generates responses using a 
different agent-role in the LLM function that emphasizes elaborating on a concept more as the job of the LLM,
which should make the response more relevant.
3. The chatbot will route the user query to InfoRequest based on the criteria of the query having any 
of a set of keywords, that imply that the user would be looking for a more detailed explanation of a concept.
